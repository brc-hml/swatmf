- If you don't already have conda installed, please download Miniconda for your operating system from https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (choose the latest version for your operating system, 64-bit). You should not need elevated rights to install this.
- Run the installer and select "only my user" when prompted. This will allow you to work with your python installation directly.

Set Environment and install libraries:
#####################################

- After installation, go to the START menu and select "Miniconda Prompt" to open a DOS box.
- Type the following command:



.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge mamba


- Using the `cd <https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm>`_ command in the Miniconda DOS box, navigate to the location where you have `environment.yml` the file and type: 

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba env create -f environment.yml

and hit ENTER.

After your virtual environment setup is complete, change the environment to `swatmf`:  

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate swatmf

- Launch jupyter notebook 

.. code-block:: bash

   jupyter notebook


A browser window with a Jupyter notebook instance should open. Yay!




.. code-block:: python
   
   >>> pip install swatmf


.. rubric:: Brief overview of the API

.. code-block:: python

   from swatmf import swatmf_pst_utils

   >>> wd = "User-SWAT-MODFLOW working directory"
   >>> swat_wd = "User-SWAT working directory"
   >>> swatmf_pst_utils.init_setup(wd, swat_wd)
